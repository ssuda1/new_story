# Clustering Analysis for New Story, Provide Housing for Earthquake Survivors

This project is on behalf of New Story, California based NPO which provides new housings to the survivors of the Haitian earthquakes. The purpose of the project is to find the most vulnerable group of survivors, who are naturally more in needs and should be prioritized in the provision of the new housing.

Special care was taken to make sure that the recepient of the new housing would be well-off as the result, because some group would actually be worse-off (for example they have been living in the same place for a long time and have to move away from their family and relatives). 

The data is not included in the repository due to the legal agreement with New Story.
